### **Our School Anthem**

We pledge to thee our school, our loyalty;<br>
Our faithful service render we to thee. <br>
Here 'neath thy banner, we shall take our stand; <br>
Thy precepts we shall cherish and defend.<br>
"Aflame for Truth" our motto ever be,<br>
Our sacred emblem the Burning Tree. <br>
"Aflame for Truth" our motto ever be, <br>
Our sacred emblem the Burning Tree.<br>

Teach us to build a brotherhood of man <br>
Till truth and justice o'er the world shall span. <br>
Grant us the strength to love, the will to give, <br>
The grace to live, the gladness to forgive. <br>
Teach us, in faith, to trust God's Fatherhood,<br>
His plan for man His purpose for our good.<br>
Teach us, in faith, to trust God's Fatherhood, <br>
His plan for man His purpose for our good.<br>

Stand like the brave! United we shall be; <br>
One happy, strong and peaceful family, <br>
Here 'neath our flag, the anthem loud we raise, <br>
Together we shall sing our song of praise. <br>
Together we shall strive courageously, <br>
God bless our school and may we steadfast be, <br>
Together we shall strive courageously, <br>
God bless our school and may we steadfast be.
