### Our School Song

We pledge to thee our school, our loyalty;
Our faithful service render we to thee. 
Here 'neath thy banner, we shall take our stand; 
Thy precepts we shall cherish and defend.
"Aflame for Truth" our motto ever be,
Our sacred emblem the Burning Tree. 
"Aflame for Truth" our motto ever be, 
Our sacred emblem the Burning Tree.

Teach us to build a brotherhood of man 
Till truth and justice o'er the world shall span. 
Grant us the strength to love, the will to give, 
The grace to live, the gladness to forgive. 
Teach us, in faith, to trust God's Fatherhood,
His plan for man His purpose for our good.
Teach us, in faith, to trust God's Fatherhood, 
His plan for man His purpose for our good.

Stand like the brave! United we shall be; 
One happy, strong and peaceful family, 
Here 'neath our flag, the anthem loud we raise, 
Together we shall sing our song of praise. 
Together we shall strive courageously, 
God bless our school and may we steadfast be, 
Together we shall strive courageously, 
God bless our school and may we steadfast be.
