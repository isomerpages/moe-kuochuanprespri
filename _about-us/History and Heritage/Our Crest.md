### Our Crest

The school crest is the "Burning Bush". The origin of the "Burning Bush" is found in the Book of Exodus, Chapter 3, verses 1-12 in the Bible.

Today, the crest speaks to us of God's presence in our midst. The life of our school is holy ground to God. We must see to it that the life of our school is always an honourable life lived with respect for one another and reverence for God. Our crest reminds us that God is at work in our midst and that He will lead and guide us and enable our school to be even better.
