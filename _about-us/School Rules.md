### **School Rules**
Schooling is an important milestone in our children’s lives. In school, they not only acquire knowledge and skills, but they are acculturated to have a set of socially acceptable behaviour and decorum. The set of school rules is an important tool to inculcate values and help establish in our children clear expectations on how they should relate to teachers and peers within the school community.

#### **Attendance**
1\. Time is a valuable resource. Children need to learn the value of time and take responsibility for their time management and punctuality. All pupils are expected to be punctual for school and school organised programmes/ activities at all times.

2\. Love for our home country is an important outcome of National Education. The daily flag raising / lowering ceremony is an opportunity for children to foster a sense of national identity, pride and self-respect. All pupils are to attend the flag raising/lowering ceremony. Pupils who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and take the Pledge.  The Pledge is taken with the right fist placed over the heart.

3\. The school is responsible for the pupils’ well-being and ensures that pupils’ safety is not compromised.
