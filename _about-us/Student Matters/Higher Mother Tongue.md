### **Higher Mother Tongue**

##### **1. What are the criteria for a child to be offered HMT at KCPPS?**

*   If a child scores Band 1 in MT and achieves Band 1 or 2 in EMS, the child will be identified by the school as eligible to take HMT in P5. Appeals can be considered for pupils who do not qualify – this is on a case-by-case basis.  
    
*   Pupils are expected to take HMT for a complete year before they can request to drop the subject.  Requests for dropping will be considered on a case by case basis.
    
*   The option to take HMT in P5 is given only once at the end of P4. Subsequent decisions will be based solely on pupil’s performance and the advice of the school.

##### **2.** **Does the PSLE score include HMT scores?**
The Aggregate T-score at PSLE includes EMS & MT T-score only. HMT is not included.

##### **3. What advantage does HMT have in terms of secondary school application?**
Students who obtained Distinction/Merit/Pass in HCL and a PSLE Score of 14 or better (i.e. PSLE Score ≤ 14) at PSLE will be eligible for posting advantage to Special Assistance Plan (SAP) schools.

This posting advantage applies before the tie-breakers for S1 posting. If multiple students with the same PSLE Score apply for places in the same SAP school, those with better HCL grades will be allocated a place ahead of other students (see table below).

| Ranking | Pupil | PSLE Score | HCL Score | PSLE + HCL Score |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| 1st | A | 7 | No HCL | 7 |
| 2nd  |  B |  8 | Distinction  | 8D  |
|  3rd |  C |  8 | Merit  | 8M  |
|  4th |  D |  8 | Pass  | 8P  |
| 5th  |  E |  8 | No HCL  | 8  |
|  6th |  F |  9 | Distinction  | 9D  |

##### **4. What are the criteria for a child to be offered HMT at KCPPS?**
*   The eligibility criteria for taking HMTL is intended to ensure that students can cope with the higher academic load, and takes reference from the current criteria.

**Eligibility criteria for Secondary School HMTL**:

    * PSLE score of 8 or better
	  
		OR
		
	* PSLE Score of 9 to 14 inclusive;
	  and attain 
       - AL1 / AL2 in MTL or
	   - Distinction / Merit in HMTL
	
 *   For students who do not meet the above criteria, secondary schools will continue to have the flexibility to offer HMTL to students, if they are assessed to have high ability and interest in MTL and are able to take HMTL without affecting their performance in other subjects.
