### **Subject-based Banding**

#### **What is Subject-based Banding?**
Subject-based Banding provides greater flexibility for your child by offering him the option of a combination of standard and foundation subjects, depending on his strengths.

Such a choice will allow your child to focus on and stretch his potential in the subjects that he is strong in while building up the fundamentals in the subjects that he needs more support in.

#### **Why introduce Subject-based Banding?**
*   To recognise the different abilities of students and give them greater flexibility to concentrate on the subjects they are good at.
*   To encourage more interaction among students with different strengths.

#### **Subject-based Banding and Secondary School admission: How are they related?**
Progression to secondary level depends on your child's PSLE score. The different expectations of standard and foundation subjects will be taken into account when your child's PSLE score is calculated.

Previously, students from EM3 stream would mostly enter the Normal (Technical) course at secondary level.

With Subject-based Banding, some students with clear strengths in some areas are able to offer at least one subject at the standard level. If they excel in these subjects, they will then have the opportunity to pursue higher-level options at secondary school.

Offering subjects at the foundation level is not a disadvantage to your child. It enables him to focus on building up strong fundamentals in these subjects and better prepares him for progression to secondary school.
