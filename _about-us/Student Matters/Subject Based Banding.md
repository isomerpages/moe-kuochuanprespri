### **Subject-based banding for primary school**

#### **What is Subject-based banding for primary school?**
Subject-based banding (SBB) gives your child the opportunity to take a combination of subjects at standard and foundation levels based on their strengths. Learn how it works and how to prepare your child.
<br><br>
Students can take a mix of standard and foundation subjects through SBB at P5 and P6. This would allow your child to:
* Stretch their potential in subjects they are strong in.
* Build up their understanding in subjects they need more with.

#### **How does SBB work??**
**Primary 4**
<br>
* Your child sits for the school exams.
* School recommends a subject combination based on their exam results at the end of the year.
* You will need to fill up an option form to indicate your child's preferred subject combination.

**Primary 5**
<br>
* Your child takes their preferred subject combination.
* School assesses their child's ability to cope with the subjects at the end of the year.
* Adjustments to the subject levels are made if needed.

**Primary 6**
<br>
* Your child takes the subject combination recommended by the school and sits for the Primary School Leaving School Examination (PSLE).
* Your child's progression to secondary level depends on their PSLE results.
* If your child excels in certain subjects, they can pursue higher level options in secondary school.

#### **What are the subject combinations available?**

* English Language
* Mother Tongue Language
* Mathematics
* Science

Higher Mother Tongue Language may also be offered if your child passes 4 subjects and does very well for Mother Tongue Language.

Students who pass 2 subjects or less will be offered the following choices:
* 4 standard subjects
* 3 standard subjects + 1 foundation subject
* 2 standard subjects + 2 foundation subject
* 4 foundation subjects

Taking subjects at the foundation level is not a disadvantage for your child. It will help them to build up the fundamentals for the subjects and better prepare them for the progression to secondary school.
