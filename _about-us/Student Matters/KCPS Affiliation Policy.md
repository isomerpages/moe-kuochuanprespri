### **KCPS Affiliation Policy**

#### **Affiliation priority under the new PSLE scoring and S1 posting systems**
The affiliation policy has fostered a strong culture of camaraderie and belonging between the two Kuo Chuan schools. Pupils from Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School (KCPPS) are eligible for priority posting to Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Secondary School (KCPSS) if they

*   meet the affiliate minimum requirement (AMR) set by KCPSS

*   indicate KCPSS as their first choice at Secondary 1 Posting

The table below shows the AMR and indicative PSLE Score ranges for KCPSS:

| Course | Affiliate Minimum Requirement (AMR) | Indicative PSLE Score Ranges for KCPSS |  |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|  |  | Affiliated | Non-Affiliated |
|  Express |  20 | 11 - 20 |  8 - 13 |
|  Normal (Academic) |  25 |  21 - 25 |  21 - 24 |

There is no change to affiliation policy in the new PSLE Scoring and S1 Posting systems.  Affiliation priority and meeting the AMRs do not guarantee admission into the affiliated secondary school. Admission is subjected to the availability of vacancies in the school. KCPSS will continue to reserve 20% of the places in each course (Exp & NA) for students who do not benefit from affiliation priority.  If the demand from affiliates exceeds the available vacancies for affiliates, they will be posted by merit based on their PSLE scores.
