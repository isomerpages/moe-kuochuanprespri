<p>Blessed Semester 2, 2025!
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>We thank you, our beloved readers, for your interest in checking out our
school website and in knowing Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School (KCPPS)
via this platform! Thank you also for reading my message.</p>
<p>As we progress through 2025, we continue to nurture a caring and enabling
school culture where learning is both engaging and meaningful. Our pupils
develop a genuine love for learning, characterised by curiosity, creative
problem-solving abilities, collaborative skills and effective communication.
We intentionally cultivate emotional intelligence in our pupils, fostering
empathy, compassion and joy. We strive to develop in them the inner strength
and confidence to achieve their goals in life.</p>
<p>KCPPS has a rich 101-year history of providing quality education. Our
journey has been remarkable, and we are filled with pride and gratitude
as we reflect on our centennial celebrations last year. These celebrations
highlighted the profound impact our school has had on countless lives over
the past century.</p>
<p>We remain a preferred choice for families. This continued popularity is
a testament to our enduring legacy and the strength of our community. We
have earned a reputation for all-round excellence in both curricular and
co-curricular areas. We provide a strong foundation in character education
and maintain a culture of care and excellence. We believe that every child
is precious, can learn and will achieve. We are proud to provide a wide
range of programmes to cater to the diverse interests, needs and talents
of our learners. We also take time to plan strategically, forge positive
relationships, celebrate success, both process and outcome, and foster
a learning environment where our entire school community thrives. We are
grateful for the dedication, heart work and hard work of our entire community:
the Presbyterian Church in Singapore, our School Management Committee,
Living Praise Presbyterian Church, alumni, parents, Parents Support Group,
and our community partners.</p>
<p>Thank you once again for your interest in KCPPS. We look forward to another
semester of growth, learning, and achievement as we continue to move forward
nimbly and confidently on the strong foundation built over the past century!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>To God be the Glory!</p>
<p>Blessings!

<br>Mrs Yee-Toh Gek Khiaw
