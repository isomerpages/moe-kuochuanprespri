<p>Blessed Semester 2, 2024!
<br>
</p>
<p>We thank you, our beloved readers, for your interest in checking out our
school website and in knowing Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School (KCPPS)
via this platform! Thank you also for reading my message.</p>
<p>We are now in the second half of 2024. We will continue to make learning
engaging and meaningful for our pupils. We want our pupils to grow up with
the right attitude for learning â€“ being curious, able to problem solve
creatively, work in collaboration and communicate effectively. Intentionally,
our pupils are nurtured with emotions like empathy, compassion and joy.
It is our endeavour to develop in them the inner strength and confidence
to push themselves to achieve their goals in life.</p>
<p>This year, we celebrate Kuo Chuan Presbyterian 100 (KCP100). KCP100 celebrations
is a gathering of our KCP community to celebrate and give thanks for God's
faithfulness in our schools for a century! In the last 100 years, we are
guided by the vision of our founders to be a beacon of faith, to lit a
flame for God and Truth.</p>
<p>We have earned a reputation of all-round excellence in both the curricular
and co-curricular areas. We provide a strong foundation in character education
and has a culture of care and excellence. We focus on educating the whole
person and we believe that every child is precious, can learn and will
achieve. It takes a whole village to raise a child. We are grateful to
the heartwork and hardwork of the whole village: The Presbyterian Church
in Singapore, our School Management Committee, our anchor church Living
Praise Presbyterian Church, Alumni, Parents, Parents Support Group and
community partners. We are proud to provide a range of programmes to cater
to the diverse interests, needs and talents of our learners. We also take
time to plan strategically, forge positive relationships, celebrate success
(recognise both process and outcome), and foster a learning environment
where our entire school community thrives.</p>
<p>KCPPS has grown from strength to strength, from a humble beginning to
becoming a school of choice today. As we celebrate our many accomplishments
and honour those who came before us, let us continue to strive, grow, and
move forward nimbly and confidently on the strong foundation built over
the past 100 years!</p>
<p></p>
<p>To God be the Glory!
<br>
</p>
<p>Blessings!
