<h3>Principal's Message</h3><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width:60%; height:50%;" height="auto" width="100%" src="/images/principal.jpg"></div><p>Blessed Year 2024! <br><br></p><p>We thank you (our beloved readers) for your interests in checking out our school website and in knowing KCPPS via this platform! Thank you also for reading my message.</p><p>My staff and I are delighted to welcome all our pupils back to school. We are pleased to extend our warmest welcome to our new Primary 1 pupils and their families!</p><p>We would like to wish our graduated Primary 6 pupils all the best as they move on to their secondary schools. They have done very well in the 2023 PSLE (with 100% passes). We praise God for His favour upon our school and for honouring the efforts put in by our pupils, staff and parents.</p><p>It is our collective desire to see our pupils ARISE and shine! Be the future-ready citizens rooted in our ARISE values! It is also our vision for them to be “Lifelong Learners and Lifelong Pals”, having the passion to learn for life and forming deep meaningful relationships with those whom they cherish. The challenges that our young learners face in the future is unimaginable. These challenges may not be the same, hence, the need to learn to manage and lead change. We will continue to grow our capabilities and capacities as a school and help our learners to navigate confidently in the complex operating system.</p><p>As the Principal of our school, I am most privileged to be able to work with a team of collegial and dedicated staff who rally together to scale the school to greater heights. KCPPS has established itself as a loving and caring school that meets the holistic needs of our pupils. We focus on educating the whole person and we believe that every child is precious, can learn and will achieve. It takes a whole village to raise a child. We are grateful to have the whole community with us. Working in close partnership with The Presbyterian Church in Singapore, our School Management Committee, our anchor church Living Praise Presbyterian Church, Alumni, Parents, Parents Support Group and community partners, we are able to provide comprehensive support for our pupils.</p><p>2024 is our Centennial Year! Since our founding in 1924, the school has grown from strength to strength, from a humble beginning to becoming a school of choice today. This will be a time for our Kuo Chuan Presbyterian family to celebrate the many accomplishments and remember those who walked before us. God brings us through all seasons and we will continue to grow and move ahead nimbly and confidently on a strong foundation built over 100 years!</p><p>To God be the Glory! <br><br></p><p>Blessings! <br><br></p><p>Mrs Yee-Toh Gek Khiaw<br>Principal<br>Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School</p><div class="isomer-image-wrapper"><img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/Updated_pic_for_P_s_message_2.jpg"></div><p></p>
