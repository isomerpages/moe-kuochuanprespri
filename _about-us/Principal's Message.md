<p>Blessed Year 2026!</p>
<p>We thank you, our dear readers, for your interest in checking out our
school website and in knowing Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School (KCPPS)
through this website! Thank you also for reading my message.</p>
<p>My staff and I are delighted to welcome all our pupils back to school.
We are especially pleased to warmly welcome our new Primary 1 pupils and
their families! We would like to wish our graduated Primary 6 pupils all
the best as they move on to their secondary schools. They have done very
well in the 2025 PSLE (with 100% passes). We praise God for His favour
upon our school and for honouring the efforts put in by our pupils, staff
and parents.</p>
<p>It is our shared hope to see our pupils ARISE and shine and be future-ready
citizens rooted in our ARISE values! It is also our vision for them to
be “Lifelong Learners and Lifelong Pals”, having the passion to learn for
life and forming deep meaningful relationships with those whom they hold
dear. The challenges that our young learners face in the future are hard
to predict. These challenges may not be the same, hence, the need to learn
to manage and lead change. We will continue to grow our capabilities and
capacities as a school community, empowering our learners to handle life’s
challenges with confidence.</p>
<p>I am deeply privileged and honoured to work alongside a team of committed
and hardworking staff who pour their hearts into lifting our school to
greater heights. We have earned a reputation of all-round excellence in
both the curricular and co-curricular areas. We provide a strong foundation
in character education and have a culture of care and excellence. We focus
on educating the whole person and we believe that every child is precious,
can learn and will achieve. It takes a whole village to raise a child.
We are grateful to the heartwork and hardwork of the whole village: The
Presbyterian Church in Singapore, our School Management Committee, our
anchor church Living Praise Presbyterian Church, Alumni, Parents, Parents
Support Group and community partners. We are proud to provide a range of
programmes to cater to the different interests, needs and talents of our
learners. We also take time to plan strategically, forge positive relationships,
celebrate success (recognise both process and outcome), and foster a learning
environment where our entire school community thrives.</p>
<p>Since our humble founding in 1924, our school has grown from strength
to strength, growing into a school of choice today. God has faithfully
brought us through all seasons, and with hearts full of gratitude, we will
continue to grow and move ahead with confidence, standing firm on the strong
foundation built over 102 remarkable years!</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>To God be the Glory!</p>
<p>Blessings!

<br>Mrs Yee-Toh Gek Khiaw
