<p class="text">Blessed Semester 2, 2023!  <br> <br>

We thank you (our beloved readers) for your interests in checking out our school website and in knowing KCPPS via this platform! Thank you also for reading my message. <br><br>

We are now in the second half of 2023. As we continue to navigate the realities and changing landscape of the Endemic Phase, we are committed to continue to provide educational experiences for every pupil to support their health and safety, holistic growth, and wellbeing.<br><br>

We have earned a reputation of all-round excellence through the heartwork and hardwork of our pupils, staff, parents, Parent Support Group, Alumni, School Management Committee, and our community partners. We are proud to have a range of programmes to cater to the diverse interests and needs of our learners. We also take time to plan strategically, forge positive relationships, celebrate success (recognise both process and outcome), and foster a learning environment where our entire school community thrives. <br><br>

In our school, we integrate learning into many pedagogical experiences for our pupils. We make learning engaging and meaningful so that they see the connection between what they learn in the classroom and the relevance for application in the real world. We want our pupils to grow up with the right attitude for learning – being curious, able to problem solve creatively, work in collaboration and communicate effectively. Intentionally, our pupils are nurtured with emotions like empathy, compassion and joy. It is our endeavour to develop in them the inner strength and confidence to push themselves to achieve their goals in life. <br><br>

This year, we celebrated our 99th Founders’ Day with the theme ‘Hope’. 
Theme Verse: *“May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit.” (Romans 15:13)*<br>Last year, our theme was ‘Faith’, anchored by God’s faithfulness in our Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Schools. This year, we remind ourselves that we anchor our ‘Hope’ in the love of Jesus Christ always. As a Kuo Chuan family, we are grateful to God for his provision and blessings upon our school over the years and we look forward to the centennial next year!<br><br>

I am privileged and honoured to have the opportunity to lead KCPPS – a school with such a rich heritage and tradition! We are a strong and vibrant school that pursues excellence in teaching and learning whilst nurturing the social and emotional competencies of our pupils to support them to become confident and resilient individuals. <br><br>

I am certain that as a big Kuo Chuan community, so long as we stay strong, stay united, and stay resilient, we will find new meaning and purpose in our collaborative endeavours, and we will emerge a better school! <br><br>


 
	

To God be the Glory!   <br><br>

Blessings! <br> <br>
