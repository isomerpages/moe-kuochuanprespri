Blessed Semester 2, 2022!

We thank you (our beloved readers) for your interests in checking out our school website and in knowing KCPPS via this platform! Thank you also for reading my message.

We are now in the second half of 2022. As we continue to navigate the realities and changing landscape of the Endemic Phase, we are committed to continue to provide educational experiences for every pupil to support their health and safety, holistic growth, and wellbeing.

We have earned a reputation of all-round excellence through the heartwork and hardwork of our pupils, staff, parents, Parent Support Group, Alumni, School Management Committee, and our community partners. We are proud to have a range of programmes to cater to the diverse interests and needs of our learners. We also take time to plan strategically, forge positive relationships, celebrate success (recognise both process and outcome), and foster a learning environment where our entire school community thrives.

This year, we celebrated our 98th Founders’ Day with the theme ‘Faith’ anchored by God’s faithfulness in our Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Schools.<br>
Theme Verse: “Because of the Lord’s great love we are not consumed, for his compassions never fail. They are new every morning; great is your faithfulness.” (Lamentations 3:22-23)<br>
As we look forward to our Centennial in 2024, we want to celebrate Hope and Love in the coming years, and affirm God’s grace and mercy in our communities.

I am privileged and honoured to have the opportunity to lead KCPPS – a school with such a rich heritage and tradition! We are a strong and vibrant school that pursues excellence in teaching and learning whilst nurturing the social and emotional competencies of our pupils to support them to become confident and resilient individuals.

I am certain that as a big Kuo Chuan community, so long as we stay strong, stay united, and stay resilient, we will find new meaning and purpose in our collaborative endeavours, and we will emerge a better school system and a better nation!

To God be the Glory!

Blessings!
