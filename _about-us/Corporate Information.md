### **School Management Committee**

The Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Schools' School Management Committee (SMC) is appointed by the Synod of the Presbyterian Church in Singapore (PCS). SMC members are drawn from the various Presbyterian churches in Singapore and are registered as managers by the Ministry of Education in accordance to the Education Act. The chairman of the SMC is registered as the supervisor. PCS commenced and owned the Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary and Secondary Schools but relied on the Ministry of Education for grants and are thus classified as government-aided schools.
