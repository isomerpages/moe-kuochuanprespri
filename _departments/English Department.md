### **English Department**

#### **Philosophy**
We prepare every KCPPian to be a lifelong learner, future-ready, grounded in values. At KCPPS, we believe in equipping all pupils with the language skills and 21st Century Competencies so as to empower them with the knowledge, dispositions and values to realise their potential and excel holistically in their areas of strength.

#### **Key Programmes & Approaches**
**Literacy Development Programme** <br>
A comprehensive instructional programme aligned to the English Language Syllabuses of 2010 and 2020. The school has adopted STELLAR since 2008, delivering the programme using the approaches in the STELLAR Pedagogic Framework. In line with the learner outcomes of Syllabus 2020, the department leverages effective questioning to deepen pupils’ learning with thinking routines to guide pupils in their thought processes so as to develop sound reasoning and decision-making skills. Effective communication is one key focus of the department’s literacy programme. Through its Co-Curriculum, E-Cube, drama is a pedagogical tool deployed to equip pupils with the skills to communicate with confidence and sensitivity in cognizance of purpose, audience, context and culture.

**KidzRead Programme** <br>
This programme aims to promote reading and language development through the approaches advocated by STELLAR for a shared reading experience in the classroom.

The school works in collaboration with the National Library Board (NLB) under the **Read@School Programme** to nurture reading among our pupils and cultivate a passion for reading for lifelong learning.

Participating in the **‘Read for Books’** charity drive, pupils read purposefully for a worthy cause.

**Reading Support Programme**<br>
This programme includes **Learning Support (LSP) and Reading Remediation** **Programmes (RRP)**, which provides pupils with basic learning foundational skills through phonemic awareness, word attack strategies and extensive reading. In partnership with reading volunteers from the Standard Chartered Bank, the school has arranged for additional support for reluctant readers under the KCPPS-StanChart Reading Programme since 2013.

**EL ShowTime** <br>
This is an annual event for Primary 1 and 2 pupils to showcase their talents and oral skills as they enunciate clearly, sing, act and dance on stage to an audience of peers and parents.
