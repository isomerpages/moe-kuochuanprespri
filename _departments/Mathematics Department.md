### **Mathematics Department**

#### **Philosophy**
In the area of Mathematics, our goal is to develop in pupils the critical thinking and creative problem solving skills. Pupils learn best when they are motivated and engaged. With these 21st Century competencies, pupils will have the autonomy to make connections in their learning.

#### **Key Programmes & Approaches**
**Mathematical Concepts and Skills**<br>
Pupils build competency in mathematical concepts and skills through student-centric activities and teacher-facilitated questioning. At KCPPS, we teach basic mathematical concepts through the Concrete-Pictorial-Abstract approach (based on Bruner’s conception of the enactive, iconic and symbolic modes of representation) with the aid of manipulatives. Lessons are also designed with the structure of ‘I do, We do, You do’ (based on Vygotsky’s Zone of Proximal Development) to develop independent learners. In addition, talk moves are used to engage pupils in deeper classroom discussion and critical thinking.

**Thinking Skills**<br>
During the learning process, teachers infuse thinking skills using ‘My Favourite No’ (to check misconceptions) and other visible thinking routines to provide opportunities for pupils to reason, communicate and make connections to their learning. Pupils are also taught an array of skills and heuristics to solve problems. Teachers as facilitators guide pupils in interpreting and analysing information, making inferences, selecting appropriate strategies to solve them, bringing about critical thinking and creative problem solving skills.

**SMART Problem Solving Routine**<br>
In developing metacognitive skills in problem solving, pupils are guided by our KCP-developed SMART routine. The department has also developed open-ended tasks, integrated mathematics and science concepts and infused financial literacy programme into the curriculum to relate learning to real life.

**Assessment for Learning and Assessment as Learning**<br>
Being reflective is an integral part of learning. In addition to pen-and-paper, we also leverage ICT tools to assess pupils’ learning to provide feedback for both pupils and teachers. Specially designed self-reflections in the form of diagnostic feedback and reflection journals as well as peer feedback are incorporated into the curriculum as part of learning.

**Environment as the 3rd Teacher**<br>
Using the environment as the third teacher, instructional posters and evidences of pupils’ learning are displayed in the classrooms. Within the school, the Mathematics Learning Corner is regularly updated with brainteasers, puzzles and did-you-know facts to make learning of Mathematics fun and interesting.

**#teasemybrain@recess**<br>
From simple to strategic board and card games, with the focus on developing pupils’ critical thinking and creative problem solving skills, these are available during scheduled recesses for all levels to cater to those who enjoy challenges.

**Learning Support for Mathematics (LSM)** <br>
LSM is specially catered to selected Primary 1 and Primary 2 pupils for small group teaching by specially-trained teachers. Use of manipulatives and questioning are incorporated for targeted teaching and learning to enable pupils to achieve mastery of basic numeracy skills and build confidence in them.

**Excellence 2000 Mathematics Programme**<br>
The E2K programme (developed by the Israel Centre for Excellence through Education (ICEE)) is part of our talent development effort for Primary 4 and Primary 5 pupils who demonstrate interest and ability in mathematics. It develops mathematical reasoning skills and deepens pupils’ conceptual understanding through an inquiry approach. Pupils have opportunities to collaborate with their peers and engage in mathematical thinking through puzzles, games and mathematical explorations.<br>

**Mathematics Olympiad Competitions**<br>
Pupils are invited to take part in Mathematics Olympiad Competitions organised by various schools in Singapore to display and receive recognition for their talent in Mathematics.
