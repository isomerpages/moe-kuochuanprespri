### **Student Management and Leadership**

#### **Philosophy**
In KCPPS, we believe that all students should be given a chance to be a student leader. Student leaders will be anchored in sound values and have a desire to serve others. The department looks into the whole-school approach towards discipline as well as equipping our pupils with leadership skills to enable them to be Exemplary Leaders who are active contributors and champions of worthy causes.

#### **Key Programmes &amp; Approaches**
At KCPPS, we adopt a two-pronged approach towards discipline. The&nbsp;**proactive discipline**&nbsp;aims to develop character and socio-emotional competencies in our pupils. It also includes enhancing teacher-student and pupil-pupil relationships. As for&nbsp;**restorative discipline**, it aims to ‘restore’ pupils who have deviated back to the established norms and re-build positive relationships, through reflection and consequences.

According to the work of Dr. Philip Vincent and Dr. Doug Grove, enforcing sound&nbsp;**rules**&nbsp;and&nbsp;**routines**&nbsp;based upon healthy teacher-student relationships will bring about the desired&nbsp;**results**&nbsp;in discipline. Hence, at KCPPS, we have a common set of school-wide routines to enable us to create an environment that is orderly and emotionally safe, conducive for teaching and learning.

**The student leadership framework shows the structure of how student leaders are developed at the different levels via the different training platforms**

In our school, we adopt ‘The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership’ as the focus for our student leadership development. All pupils first learn to be a personal leader through our values-based curriculum.&nbsp; Being personal leaders allow pupils to learn self-management skills and be good role models. Peer Leadership allows all pupils to have opportunities to be peer leaders in class.&nbsp; The Student Councillors, CCA leaders and House Captains form the next tier of leader – People Leadership. Through the different training platforms, pupils learn various leadership skills to equip them for their leadership roles.
