<h3><strong>Student Management and Leadership</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Philosophy</strong></h4>
<p>In KCPPS, we believe that all students should be given a chance to be
a student leader. Student leaders will be anchored in sound values and
have a desire to serve others. The department looks into the whole-school
approach towards discipline as well as equipping our pupils with leadership
skills to enable them to be Exemplary Leaders who are active contributors
and champions of worthy causes.</p>
<h4><strong>Key Programmes &amp; Approaches</strong></h4>
<p>At KCPPS, we adopt a two-pronged approach towards discipline. The&nbsp;<strong>proactive discipline</strong>&nbsp;aims
to develop character and socio-emotional competencies in our pupils. It
also includes enhancing teacher-student and pupil-pupil relationships.
As for&nbsp;<strong>restorative discipline</strong>, it aims to ‘restore’
pupils who have deviated back to the established norms and re-build positive
relationships, through reflection and consequences.</p>
<p>According to the work of Dr. Philip Vincent and Dr. Doug Grove, enforcing
sound&nbsp;<strong>rules</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>routines</strong>&nbsp;based
upon healthy teacher-student relationships will bring about the desired&nbsp;<strong>results</strong>&nbsp;in
discipline. Hence, at KCPPS, we have a common set of school-wide routines
to enable us to create an environment that is orderly and emotionally safe,
conducive for teaching and learning.</p>

<p><strong>The student leadership framework shows the structure of how student leaders are developed at the different levels via the different training platforms</strong>
</p>
<p>In our school, we adopt ‘The Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership’ as
the focus for our student leadership development. All pupils first learn
to be a personal leader through our values-based curriculum.&nbsp; Being
personal leaders allow pupils to learn self-management skills and be good
role models. Peer Leadership allows all pupils to have opportunities to
be peer leaders in class.&nbsp; The Student Councillors, CCA leaders and
House Captains form the next tier of leader – People Leadership. Through
the different training platforms, pupils learn various leadership skills
to equip them for their leadership roles.</p>
