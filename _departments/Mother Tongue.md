### **Mother Tongue Languages**

#### **Philosophy**
“十年树木，百年树人” <br>
“It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to nurture a man.”

Nurturing a child to be effectively bilingual is not an easy journey. “Active Learner, Confident Communicator of Mother Tongue Language and Culture” is our vision. At KCPPS, we aim to develop pupils as individuals with a positive spirit in the pursuit of excellence in Mother Tongue (MT) language skills and the love for their cultures.

#### **Key Programmes &amp; Approaches**
With the complete implementation of the new MT syllabus for all levels in 2020, the teaching of MTL is conducted progressively, and anchored in the fundamental skills of Listening, Speaking, Reading and Writing.

**Reading Programme**<br>
KCPPians are encouraged to read beyond their textbooks. To cultivate a love for reading and to encourage pupils to read MTL books widely, every classroom has a class library. To complement this, the department has a subscription of educational magazine/publications. Primary 1 to Primary 4 pupils learning Chinese Language also subscribe to Dudu, an adaptive online Chinese reading programme that caters e-books to individual pupil’s reading ability. Parents can support their child’s daily reading at home by listening and writing words of encouragement in the pupil’s Reading Aloud Logbook.

The Reading Mum Programme (CL), in partnership with parent volunteers, provides additional reading support for reluctant readers, supporting them in word recognition. The Reading Mums carry out reading aloud, storytelling and reading comprehension activities with the pupils. Annually, the MT Languages departments participate in reading activities organised by the National Library Board.

The department believes reading is the key to developing multiple skills. Through extensive reading, pupils will be able to master the language efficiently, broaden their vocabulary knowledge, acquire comprehension skills and in turn, be able to express their thoughts both verbally and in writing.

**Writing Programme**<br>
In order for KCPPians to write confidently, we have adopted a spiral approach to teaching writing. Teachers have designed a series of writing programmes, aimed at levelling up pupils’ writing competencies. At the lower primary level, pupils learn basic writing skills through words, grammar, vocabulary and sentence structures. At the middle primary, pupils are taught how to write introductions and conclusions, paragraphing and sequencing. At KCPPS, Primary 3 pupils start to use the CL Composition Reference Book 《一小笔，一大步》/ ML or TL Composition Reference List to guide them in writing introductions and conclusions. Primary 3 and Primary 4 pupils go through open book assessments for composition writing to encourage them to write confidently. At the upper primary levels, pupils learn to enhance their plots with different, realistic turning points as the focus.

In 2020, a Chinese Composition Compilation and Publication 《小笔迹，大创意》was published. It is a compilation of pupils’ lively and individual voices with interesting content and descriptions. This publication not only commemorates the pupils’ achievement, but also preserves the memories they have made together with ink and paper.&nbsp; We hope that the authentic, age-appropriate publication can inspire pupils to think positively about composition writing.

**Cultural Programmes**<br>
Appreciating our diversity and rich culture is crucial to every child in Singapore. The MT Department strives not only to achieve academic excellence but also provide rich cultural learning experiences for the pupils. We strongly believe that learning comes “alive” through authentic learning experiences. Pupils are exposed to all aspects of language and culture through various activities and learning journeys, where learning is extended beyond the classroom.

Celebrations of festivals (Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, Deepavali) are introduced purposefully at KCPPS to enhance pupils’ knowledge and appreciation of their cultures and as well as their diversity.

Annually, the Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration “月儿圆圆庆中秋” is an evening celebratory event for our lower and middle primary pupils and their parents. As part of our cultural programme, the celebration aims to immerse KCPPians in the festive mood as they bond with their families to create awareness of the Chinese traditional culture and customs.

The department seizes opportunities at annual festive seasons to encourage our pupils to show Amazing Love for the residents of Bishan Home for the Intellectually Disabled: Food donation drive - “Share The Joy!” is done through Primary 5 Hamper Wrapping Competition during Chinese New Year and the Mooncake donation drive - “A Thoughtful Mid-Autumn!” is organised for Primary 1 to Primary 3 pupils.

Mother Tongue Fortnight cum Racial Harmony Day Celebration is another highlight of KCPPS MT Cultural Programme. During the fortnight, the MT Department creates an environment that encourages pupils to use MTL and appreciate the cultures associated with the languages. Apart from concerts, an array of exciting classroom activities for the levels are organised to allow pupils to experience a wide range of cross cultural activities related to the Chinese, Malay, Indian languages and cultures. Different traditional games and culture activities, as well as food, are introduced to the pupils during the recess activities.

MT Assembly is another platform to promote linguistic and cultural diversity through various assembly programmes and activities that are held termly/semesterly for the pupils in their respective languages.

**Mother Tongue Language &amp; Cultural Centre (MTLCC)**<br>
The MTLCC is a designated space for KCPPians to explore Mother Tongue Languages and cultures. It was set up in 2019 for pupils to learn MT independently or interdependently.&nbsp; With the objective “Explore, Learn and Socialize”, the department hopes to promote socialisation through engaged learning of various cultural activities in enriched settings, where pupils from different age groups and races learn together using the interactive materials provided.
