### **CCA**

#### **Philosophy**
Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) provide a platform in building the character of the pupils, honing their leadership skills and cultivating a can-do spirit. Participation in CCAs allows qualities such as resilience, teamwork, confidence and perseverance to be nurtured as well. These qualities will prepare the pupils to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing world.

#### **Key Programmes &amp; Approaches**
The school provides a balanced, inclusive and diverse CCA programme which caters to a broad spectrum of interests and talents.

Our CCAs cover the following&nbsp;**four**&nbsp;domains: <br>
1\. Sports &amp; Games  
2\. Visual and Performing Arts  
3\. Uniformed Groups  
4\. Clubs and Societies

##### **Objectives of CCA**

1.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To provide a broader school-life experience&nbsp;**beyond the academics**&nbsp;and cater to the pupils’ abilities, interest and / or talents through learning&nbsp;**CCA-specific knowledge, skills and attitudes**&nbsp;in a progressive curriculum that is age appropriate.  

2.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To inculcate&nbsp;**core school values**&nbsp;and develop&nbsp;**pupils’ character**&nbsp;through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups: Physical Sports, Visual and Performing Arts, Uniformed Groups and Clubs and Societies.

3.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To create a common space for cross level social interaction and social integration and for pupils to learn&nbsp;**social and emotional competencies as well as the 21st Century Competencies**.

4.&nbsp; To kindle and nurture in the pupils a&nbsp;**lifelong affinity for an interest**&nbsp;which helps them to lead a balanced life in adulthood.
