### **CCA**

#### **Philosophy**
Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) provide a platform in building the character of the pupils, honing their leadership skills and cultivating a can-do spirit. Participation in CCAs allows qualities such as resilience, teamwork, confidence and perseverance to be nurtured as well. These qualities will prepare the pupils to adapt and thrive in a rapidly changing world.

#### **Key Programmes & Approaches**
The school provides a balanced, inclusive and diverse CCA programme which caters to a broad spectrum of interests and talents.

Our CCAs cover the following **four** domains: <br>
1\. Sports & Games  
2\. Visual and Performing Arts  
3\. Uniformed Groups  
4\. Clubs and Societies

##### **Objectives of CCA**

1.     To provide a broader school-life experience **beyond the academics** and cater to the pupils’ abilities, interest and / or talents through learning **CCA-specific knowledge, skills and attitudes** in a progressive curriculum that is age appropriate.  

2.     To inculcate **core school values** and develop **pupils’ character** through sustained participation in any of the CCA groups: Physical Sports, Visual and Performing Arts, Uniformed Groups and Clubs and Societies.

3.     To create a common space for cross level social interaction and social integration and for pupils to learn **social and emotional competencies as well as the 21st Century Competencies**.

4.  To kindle and nurture in the pupils a **lifelong affinity for an interest** which helps them to lead a balanced life in adulthood.
