<p><strong>17th GoodTalk (Global Village) International Children &amp; Youth Bilingual Speech Conference (Preliminary Competition)<br>第17届 GoodTalk (地球村) 国际青少年双语演讲大会 (初赛）</strong>

<p>The conference aims to provide an opportunity for pupil participants from
Singapore and China to enhance their bilingual abilities and global competence.
The topic for this year’s Preliminary Competition is “When I Meet Myself”,
which encourages participants to unleash their imagination, blending reality
and the future to reflect on how AI development might reshape personal
life, while also expressing their understanding and vision of the human–AI
relationship.</p>
<p>We are happy to share the results from the first round of the competition.
We are very proud of every pupil who took part. All of them are winners
and we are extremely proud of their hard work!</p>
