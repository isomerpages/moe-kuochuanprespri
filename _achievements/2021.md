**Cross Border e-Book**

  

‘Ben Makes HIS CHOICE’ is the first e-book written by a group of 10 KCPPians as a community outreach project in collaboration with Roots & Shoots – Jane Goodall Institute (Singapore) and Winthrop Primary School (Perth, Australia).

  

A simple story it may be, but its aim at inspiring others to make environmentally-friendly choices on the use of plastics in our everyday lives is commendable of our ten-year-olds.

  

Let’s make every little effort count. Make ‘_Go Green Our Way of Life’_.

"Fight COVID-19: World Charity Painting Competition" was organized by the Asian Art Association in 2020 to commemorate the outbreak of COVID-19 and inspire the world with the art of painting and show concern for life.

  

The competition was judged by 12 famous painters from around the world with the best works being donated to a hospital or auctioned to a novel coronavirus patient. The proceeds will be used to set up a welfare fund for those affected by the novel coronavirus. 25 of our pupils took part in the competition and our school is delighted to share their results.

 

Additionally, our school has been identified as one of the schools that will receive the ‘Schools with Outstanding Artistic Characteristics’ Award.

**PacificLight Crea8 Sustainability Competition 2021**  

The PacificLight Crea8 Sustainability Competition aims to inspire young Singaporeans to tackle environmental challenges and demonstrate their passion for a sustainable Singapore by showing how waste can be reused, repurposed and recycled.

  

**Christine Loo Sze Hui (6A)**, our CCA leader of Eco-Club, represented the club and submitted an entry - Eco-stool. We are glad to share that the entry has won the First Prize for the Upper Primary Category! Congratulations to Christine and our Eco-Club!

  

The Eco-stool is made of 12 eco-bricks, each of which is a 1.5-litre plastic bottle filled with plastic materials. These eco-bricks were made with the help of the Eco-Club members during the CCA sessions, and the P6 members then helped to construct and decorate the Eco-stools using plastic straws and reused plastic container covers.

  

The artwork was showcased at a month-long exhibition at the Singapore Sustainable Gallery @ Marina Barrage from 14 July to 9 August.
