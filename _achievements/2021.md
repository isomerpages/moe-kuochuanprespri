**Cross Border e-Book**

  

‘Ben Makes HIS CHOICE’ is the first e-book written by a group of 10 KCPPians as a community outreach project in collaboration with Roots & Shoots – Jane Goodall Institute (Singapore) and Winthrop Primary School (Perth, Australia).

  

A simple story it may be, but its aim at inspiring others to make environmentally-friendly choices on the use of plastics in our everyday lives is commendable of our ten-year-olds.

  

Let’s make every little effort count. Make ‘_Go Green Our Way of Life’_.

**Fight COVID-19: World Charity Painting Competition**

  

"Fight COVID-19: World Charity Painting Competition" was organized by the Asian Art Association in 2020 to commemorate the outbreak of COVID-19 and inspire the world with the art of painting and show concern for life.

  

The competition was judged by 12 famous painters from around the world with the best works being donated to a hospital or auctioned to a novel coronavirus patient. The proceeds will be used to set up a welfare fund for those affected by the novel coronavirus. 25 of our pupils took part in the competition and our school is delighted to share their results.

 

Additionally, our school has been identified as one of the schools that will receive the ‘Schools with Outstanding Artistic Characteristics’ Award.
