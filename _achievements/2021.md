**Cross Border e-Book**

  

‘Ben Makes HIS CHOICE’ is the first e-book written by a group of 10 KCPPians as a community outreach project in collaboration with Roots & Shoots – Jane Goodall Institute (Singapore) and Winthrop Primary School (Perth, Australia).

  

A simple story it may be, but its aim at inspiring others to make environmentally-friendly choices on the use of plastics in our everyday lives is commendable of our ten-year-olds.

  

Let’s make every little effort count. Make ‘_Go Green Our Way of Life’_.
