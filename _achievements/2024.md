<h3><strong>Achievements 2024</strong></h3>
<p><strong>2023 National English Writing Competition (NEW-C) Results</strong>
</p>
<p>Organised by Singapore Young Writers Press, the National English Writing
Competition (NEW-C) is an on-the-spot writing competition for children
between 8 and 12 years old to promote works by children, for children.
Through this competition and the publication of the entries, the organisation
hopes to inspire children to believe that it is possible to write good
stories under time constraints when they see their peers doing so. In addition,
they will also benefit from reading quality works. The competition also
serves to recognise and encourage budding talents.</p>

part in this competition in 2023. We are delighted to share that <strong>Kayla Chin Kaiyi (6 Grace, 2023)</strong> was
