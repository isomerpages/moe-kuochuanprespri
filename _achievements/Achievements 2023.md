### **Achievements 2023**

**14th GoodTalk (Global Village) International Children & Youth Bilingual Speech Conference<br>第14届 GoodTalk(地球村)国际青少年双语演讲大会**

The objectives of the conference are to promote the understanding and appreciation of the language and culture of the pupil participants from Singapore and China. In addition, the conference aims to support the Speak Mandarin Campaign in Singapore. Participants in Singapore could learn to converse and express themselves in the Chinese language.
This year’s topics are:<br>
• Topic 1: The Universe I Know / "Math And The Universe" (主题一: 我知道的宇宙 / “数学与宇宙”) where participants can express their thoughts, conjectures, what they hope to explore, and what answers they hope to get from mathematics to the universe through speeches.<br>
• Topic 2: The "AI" Around Me / The Present And Future Of AI (主题二: 我身边的“人工智能”/ 人工智能的现在与未来) where participants lead us to open the door between the virtual world and the real world, and share the "AI" situation they have seen, felt, and foreseen.

Congratulations to the following pupils for their achievements in the Preliminary Round!

**2022 National English Writing Competition (NEW-C) Results**

Organised by Singapore Young Writers Press, the National English Writing Competition (NEW-C) is an on-the-spot writing competition for children between 8 to 12 years old to promote works by children, for children. Through this competition and the publication of the entries, the organisation hopes to inspire children to believe that it is possible to write good stories under time constraints when they see their peers doing so. In addition, they will also benefit from reading quality works. The competition also serves to recognise and encourage budding talents. 

We are delighted to share that **Roanne Wong (6 Brilliance 2022)** was awarded the **1st Prize** for Category 2 (Primary 5 and Primary 6). Congratulations to her!
