**International Young Reporters for the Environment (YRE) Competition 2020**

The International YRE Competition is organised through the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) with the objective of providing a platform for young people to articulate their stand on environmental issues they feel strongly about.

Towards the end of 2019, our school hosted staff and pupils from Sekolah Kebangsaan Bukit Lintang, a Green Flag School in Malacca, through WWF Singapore. The two schools shared and learnt from each other about sustainability issues and greening strategies. After the visit, pupils from both schools collaborated and jointly submitted a video entitled ‘Food Waste and Climate Change’ for the YRE Competition 2020 (International Collaboration Category).

We are pleased to share that the joint-submission has been awarded 1st Place! We would like to acknowledge the following pupils from **P6 Excellence (2019)** on their efforts towards raising awareness on environmental issues.
