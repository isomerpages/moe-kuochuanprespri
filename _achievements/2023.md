**Guitar Ensemble's Performance at Bishan East - Sin Ming 58th National Day Dinner**

Our Guitar Ensemble performed at the Bishan East – Sin Ming 58th National Day Dinner on 12 August to a crowd of over two thousand. In the spirit of National Day, the audience was treated to two instrumental pieces, ‘Home’ and ‘Oh, Singapura’.

The final item was a strum-and-sing-a-long where the audience joined in the singing of ‘Singapore Town’ accompanied by the strumming of the ensemble. We are proud of our members for being able to rise to the occasion to give their best performance. Their hours of practice and ability to overcome their initial nervousness exemplify our school values of ARISE. Well done, Guitar Ensemble!

**Learning for Life (LLP) Programme - Partnership with TOUCH Community Services**

In Semester Two, the Visual Arts Club partnered TOUCH Community Services to embark on a unique artistic journey. Four of the Visual Arts Club members and artists with special needs from TOUCH Community Services were given the opportunity to work together, sharing ideas, emotions, and experiences to co-create a meaningful piece of artwork. They utilised various artistic elements to convey the notion of a young sapling tree, symbolising the growth of our pupils into responsible citizens who embody the ARISE values. The colour scheme chosen for the artwork draws from our school's house colours, comprising blue, green, purple, red and yellow. The artwork would be featured in memorabilia as part of the primary school’s centennial celebrations next year. This initiative, which is a part of the school’s Values-in-Action programme, aimed to sow the seeds of empathy in pupils, offering them a platform to embrace diversity and understand the unique challenges faced by individuals with special needs. It was a memorable learning experience for our pupils who had put their talents to good use by contributing to the cause of forging an inclusive society. Well done, pupils! We are very proud of you!
