### **Greening Kok Chuan (Environment Education Programme)**

In the 21st Century, sustainable development is the key to progress. The Greening Kuo Chuan (GKC) Environment Education Programme is our response to involve our pupils in sustainability efforts. Over the years, the programme has evolved from its fledgling stage of tending garden plots to encompassing five key areas of sustainability: Biodiversity, Environment, Energy, Water and Waste. GKC collaborates with the English, Character and Citizenship, Art and Science Departments to put up curated exhibitions, commemorative events, school-wide exercises, school-based nature trails and community outreach. GKC also leverages the support of parents and external partners to put together assembly talks and source for educational paraphernalia. With the schoolâ€™s support, we also participate in national competitions on environmental issues to provide a platform for our pupils to apply their learning.
