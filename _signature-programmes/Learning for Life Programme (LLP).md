### **Learning for Life Programme (LLP) − Visual Art and Design**

Let’s-Think-Design is what our Learning for Life Programme aims to do – to provide time and space for our pupils to unleash their creativity as they apply their learning about design to their artwork. Through the inquiry-based learning approach in the Let’s-Think-Design series, pupils learn about the different elements of design. They are then empowered to translate their ideas into powerful visual images to promote worthy causes and raise awareness in the community through the messages and design of their posters, murals and bags.
