### **Parent Support Group**

We hold the belief that the home, school and community share the goal in creating an environment that supports our children’s learning and development. It is with this understanding and effort that we receive much support from the members of our Parent Support Group (PSG) over the past years.

Their belief in us, their presence in school and their efforts in supporting their children’s learning have created a more vibrant, conducive and holistic learning environment. They have worked closely with the staff on programmes and projects throughout the years since the inception of the group. The support from our PSG has indeed provided for a more joyful and meaningful experience for our pupils in Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School.
