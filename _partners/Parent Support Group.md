### **Parent Support Group**

We hold the belief that the home, school and community share the goal in creating an environment that supports our children’s learning and development. It is with this understanding and effort that we receive much support from the members of our Parent Support Group (PSG) over the past years.

Their belief in us, their presence in school and their efforts in supporting their children’s learning have created a more vibrant, conducive and holistic learning environment. They have worked closely with the staff on programmes and projects throughout the years since the inception of the group. The support from our PSG has indeed provided for a more joyful and meaningful experience for our pupils in Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School.

#### **BE PART OF YOUR CHILD'S LIFE IN KCPPS - JOIN THE PSG!**



We welcome parents with children currently studying in KCPPS to volunteer in PSG activities. You may send your request via email to kcppspsg@gmail.com, or keep a lookout for volunteer opportunities shared through your class chat group.

If you are interested in volunteering as part of your child’s enrolment to KCPPS (via Phase 2B), please contact the KCPPS General Office at 6259 5396 or email to kcpps@moe.edu.sg.
