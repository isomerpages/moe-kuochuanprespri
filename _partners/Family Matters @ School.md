### **Family Matters @ School**

The Family Matters@School (FMS) is supported by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) to provide parents with access to family life programmes that enable them to better connect with their children. Since November 2019, MSF has introduced a new regional approach to service delivery through Parenting Support Providers (PSPs). PSPs are one-stop service providers which work closely with schools within their allocated regions, to deliver evidence-based parenting programmes (Triple P) to parents and to provide follow-on counselling support to parents who need it. The Triple P seminars and counselling sessions are fully subsidised for you by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).

For KCPPS, TOUCH Community Services is our PSP.
