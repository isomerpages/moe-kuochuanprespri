### **Partnership with Parents**
KCPPS believes strongly in the importance of a strong collaboration between parents and teachers to foster a positive and supportive environment for the holistic development of our pupils.

### **Dads for Life (DFL)**

Dads for Life is a National Fathers Movement that seeks to inspire, mobilise and involve fathers to become good influencers in their children’s lives… for Life!

Since 2009, KCPPS has supported the DFL movement and organised programmes for pupils to take part with their fathers. From 2020, with the cessation of funding, the KCPPS Parent Support Group continued to organise DFL activities using its own resources. The programme was put on hold between 2020 and 2022 due to the pandemic. In 2023, the DFL programme resumed during the endemic phase, providing opportunities for our pupils to bond together with their fathers. 

### **Families for Life (FFL)**

In 2024, the school transitioned from DFL to FFL to promote a “Families for Life” mindset among KCPPS families. This shift enables our pupils to bond with both parents together, fostering stronger family connections.

The key objectives of the FFL programme are to:
* Equip parents with essential parenting skills;
* Strengthen parent-child bonds and overall family relationships; and
* Provide a supportive network for parents to share experiences and challenges.

We aim to strengthen the KCPPS community by strengthening familial ties and bonds between pupils.
